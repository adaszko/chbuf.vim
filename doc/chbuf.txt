*:ChangeBuffer* [|pattern|]

    |pattern| are not shown.

    This command honours 'ignorecase'.

    |pattern| are not shown.

    This command honours 'ignorecase'.

*:Spotlight* [{query}]

    Executes raw mdfind {query} and presents results as a getline menu.
    Provides some simple raw mdfind query keywords completion.  See
    |chbuf-references| for exact syntax of a query.  Examples:

    :Spotlight kMDItemContentType == 'public.plain-text' && kMDItemFSName == '*foo*'

    :Spotlight kMDItemFSInvisible == '*' && kMDItemFSName == '*bar*'

    Only available on Mac OS X.
