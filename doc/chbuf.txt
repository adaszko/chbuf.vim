EXPORTS                                                     *chbuf-exports*
COMMANDS                                                    *chbuf-commands*

*:ChangeBuffer* [|pattern|]

    Jumps to one of loaded buffers (as listed in |:ls|.)  Buffers matching
    |pattern| are not shown.

    This command honours 'ignorecase'.

*:ChangeMixed* [|pattern|]

    Jumps to loaded buffer OR a file from |v:oldfiles|.  Buffers matching
    |pattern| are not shown.

    This command honours 'ignorecase'.

*:ChangeFile*

    Jumps to a file placed anywhere in current directory subtree.  This may be
    arbitrarily slow depending on how high in directory tree you currently are
    and how many files you have in your file system (|CTRL-C| is your friend.)
    If you’re on Mac OS X, use |:Spotlight| instead as it is much faster and
    more general.

    This command honours 'ignorecase' and 'wildignore'.

*:ChangeDirectory*

    Jumps to any directory located below working one.  |chbuf-CTRL-I| executes |:cd|
    on the one listed first, whereas |chbuf-CTRL-L| executes |:lcd|.

    This command honours 'ignorecase' and 'wildignore'.

*:Spotlight* [{query}]

    Executes raw mdfind {query} and presents results as a getline menu.
    Provides some simple raw mdfind query keywords completion.  See
    |chbuf-references| for exact syntax of a query.  Examples:

    :Spotlight kMDItemContentType == 'public.plain-text' && kMDItemFSName == '*foo*'

    :Spotlight kMDItemFSInvisible == '*' && kMDItemFSName == '*bar*'

    Only available on Mac OS X.


KEYS                                                        *chbuf-keys*

This section lists only the keys that are not defined by getline internally or
their behaviour has been redefined for the purposes of chbuf.  Please refer to
|getline-keys| section for further information.


CTRL-I                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-I*
<Tab>                                                       *chbuf-<Tab>*

    Changes current directory (|:cd|) to the one listed first or to the
    directory in which file list first is placed.

CTRL-L                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-L*

    Like |chbuf-CTRL-I| but executes |:lcd| instead of |:cd|.

CTRL-S                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-S*

    Jumps to the first item in selections list in a new horizontal split.

CTRL-V                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-V*

    Like |chbuf-CTRL-S| but splits vertically.

CTRL-T                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-T*

    Like |chbuf-CTRL-S| but open the selection in a new tab instead of split.

CTRL-Y                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-Y*

    Copies the full path of current selection into |v:register|.

CTRL-M                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-M*
<CR>                                                        *chbuf-<CR>*

    Executes |:edit| on item listed first.


CAVEATS                                                     *chbuf-caveats*

There will be troubles when using |:Spotlight| with file names on your file
system containing newline characters.


REFERENCES                                                  *chbuf-references*
