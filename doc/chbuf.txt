EXPORTS                                                     *chbuf-exports*
COMMANDS                                                    *chbuf-commands*

*:ChangeBuffer* [|pattern|]

    Jumps to one of loaded buffers (as listed in |:ls|.)  Buffers matching
    |pattern| are not shown.

    This command honours 'ignorecase'.

*:ChangeMixed* [|pattern|]

    Jumps to loaded buffer OR a file from |v:oldfiles|.  Buffers matching
    |pattern| are not shown.

    This command honours 'ignorecase'.

*:ChangeFile*

    Jumps to a file placed anywhere in current directory subtree.  This may be
    arbitrarily slow depending on how high in directory tree you currently are
    and how many files you have in your file system (|CTRL-C| is your friend.)
    If you’re on Mac OS X, use |:Spotlight| instead as it is much faster and
    more general.

    This command honours 'ignorecase' and 'wildignore'.

*:ChangeDirectory*

    Issues an |:cd| on a directory in current directory subtree.  See also
    |chbuf-<Tab>|.

    This command honours 'ignorecase' and 'wildignore'.

*:LocalChangeDirectory*

    Like |:ChangeDirectory| but uses |:lcd| instead of |:cd|.

    This command honours 'ignorecase' and 'wildignore'.

*:Spotlight* [{query}]

    Executes raw mdfind {query} and presents results as a getline menu.
    Provides some simple raw mdfind query keywords completion.  See
    |chbuf-references| for query syntax.

    Only available on Mac OS X.


KEYS                                                        *chbuf-keys*

This section lists the keys that are not defined by getline internally or
their behaviour has been redefined for the purposes of chbuf.


CTRL-I                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-I*
<Tab>                                                       *chbuf-<Tab>*

    For |:ChangeDirectory| it changes current directory (|:lcd|) to the
    selection and continues, for every other command exported by chbuf, it
    jumps to the first item in selections list and also changes current
    directory (again, |:lcd|) to where that file is placed.

CTRL-S                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-S*

    Jumps to the first item in selections list in a new horizontal split.

CTRL-V                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-V*

    Like |chbuf-CTRL-S| but splits vertically.

CTRL-T                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-T*

    Like |chbuf-CTRL-S| but open the selection in a new tab instead of split.

CTRL-Y                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-Y*

    Copies the full path of current selection into v:register.

CTRL-M                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-M*
<CR>                                                        *chbuf-<CR>*

    The behaviour of <CR> is just like |getline-CTRL-M| with the exception
    that you’re not allowed to select non-existent file.  Use |chbuf-CTRL-N|
    to force even if file doesn’t exist.

CTRL-N                                                      *chbuf-CTRL-N*

    Like |chbuf-CTRL-M| but allows for selection even of non-existent file.


CAVEATS                                                     *chbuf-caveats*

There will be troubles when using |:Spotlight| with file names on your file
system containing newline characters.


REFERENCES                                                  *chbuf-references*
